what,62.78,63.07
this,63.08,63.38
was,63.38,63.54

at,65.559999,65.669999
the,65.67,65.85

it's,90.68,90.87
quite,90.87,91.14
actually,91.18,91.72
an,91.73,91.9

now,92.72,92.92

in,173.44,173.51
this,173.509999,173.709999

at,174.88,175.02
both,175.02,175.3

uh,179.629999,179.819999
and,179.82,180.09
end,180.119999,180.329999
up,180.33,180.48
with,180.49,180.72
some,180.72,180.95

about,181.91,182.22
computation,182.22,182.98
so,184.61,184.96
one,184.97,185.21
thing,185.21,185.41
we're,185.41,185.51
gonna,185.51,185.73
talk,185.73,185.93
about,185.94,186.12
i,186.12,186.19
already,186.19,186.39
mentioned,186.39,186.69
in,186.69,186.71
is,186.71,186.8

[noise],188.58,188.93
so,188.929999,189.339999
what,189.349999,189.529999
is,189.53,189.55
an,189.57,189.64
abstract,189.65,190.04
machine,190.04,190.32
is,190.32,190.47
is,190.469999,190.699999
really,190.73,191
a,191,191.07

of,192.09,192.2

ah,193.07,193.22
actually,193.23,193.68
for,193.679999,193.819999
the,193.82,193.9
lecture,193.9,194.21
we,194.21,194.33
have,194.33,194.47
kind,194.48,194.62

a,194.73,194.77

that,195.63,195.84
mimics,196.35,196.89
ah,196.889999,197.019999
what,197.039999,197.209999
you,197.209999,197.309999
might,197.309999,197.509999

[noise],198.85,199.42
uh,199.42,199.56
it's,199.56,199.72
so,199.72,199.95
every,199.98,200.21
there's,200.22,200.44

we're,209.259999,209.369999
gonna,209.37,209.56

on,215.57,215.61

we'll,215.940001,216.040001
look,216.039999,216.159999
at,216.16,216.22

i,216.62,216.74
write,216.74,216.98
and,216.98,217.07
we'll,217.07,217.16

in,217.79,217.92
a,217.92,217.96

on,224.53,224.61
the,224.61,224.71

we,224.929999,225.019999
have,225.02,225.15
an,225.15,225.22

that's,227.62,227.84
the,227.84,227.96

articulate,243.36,243.88
the,243.88,243.98

then,244.5,244.91
you're,244.95,245.25
