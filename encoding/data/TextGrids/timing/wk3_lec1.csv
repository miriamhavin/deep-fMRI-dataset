today,23.46,23.86
let's,25.98,26.11
start,26.11,26.36
with,26.36,26.51
a,26.51,26.55

first,28.59,29.05
a,29.13,29.25
basic,29.259999,29.639999

we,30.38,30.54

a,31.849999,31.959999

and,35.889999,36.309999
we,36.309999,36.419999
looked,36.42,36.63
at,36.63,36.75
a,36.75,36.81

we,39.47,39.6
been,39.6,39.75
using,39.75,40.26

the,40.44,40.53

our,41.53,41.64

up,42.62,42.78
to,42.78,42.89
this,42.89,43.11

these,56.91,57.23
