today's,4.08,4.39
topic,4.39,4.72
is,4.72,4.85
a,4.85,4.9
very,4.9,5.12
important,5.12,5.56
one,5.56,5.86
as,6.07,6.27
we,6.27,6.58
address,6.72,7.14
more,7.16,7.38
sophisticated,7.38,8.05
applications,8.05,8.83
as,8.94,9.05
programs,9.05,9.54
get,9.54,9.7
bigger,9.71,10.01
and,10.01,10.17
bigger,10.17,10.54
than,10.69,10.81
the,10.809999,10.899999
problem,10.9,11.28
of,11.28,11.41
organizing,11.44,12.15
the,12.15,12.28
program,12.37,12.93
so,13.09,13.29
that,13.29,13.41
we,13.41,13.54
can,13.54,13.89
ah,14.139999,14.329999
maintain,14.349999,14.809999
it,14.809999,14.989999
easily,15.19,15.73
an,15.73,15.97
add,15.98,16.18
new,16.18,16.37
code,16.379999,16.739999
is,16.9,17.05
a,17.049999,17.099999
very,17.1,17.33
important,17.33,17.73
one,17.73,18
so,18.34,18.54
topic,18.45,18.81
topic,18.539999,18.809999
of,18.81,18.94
functions,18.94,19.41
in,19.41,19.56
libraries,19.56,20.14
is,20.14,20.26
the,20.26,20.36
mechanism,20.36,20.91
that,20.91,21.07
we,21.07,21.19
use,21.19,21.53
to,21.53,21.63
help,21.63,21.87
us,21.87,22.08
maintain,22.27,22.74
and,22.74,22.85
organize,22.85,23.33
our,23.33,23.43
programs,23.43,24.05
let's,25.34,25.54
look,25.54,25.68
at,25.68,25.77
some,25.77,25.93
basic,25.93,26.29
concepts,26.3,27
ah,27.469999,27.769999
this,28.24,28.43
is,28.429999,28.589999
our,28.59,29.31
basic,29.309999,29.629999
building,29.63,29.9
blocks,29.9,30.18
for,30.179999,30.299999
programing,30.3,30.73
that,30.74,30.9
we,30.9,31
talked,31,31.26
about,31.259999,31.529999
and,31.53,31.67
we’re,31.67,31.81
quite,31.809999,32.019999
near,32.02,32.18
the,32.179999,32.269999
top,32.27,32.53
now,32.53,32.85
what,33.059999,33.229999
we,33.23,33.32
wanna,33.32,33.58
talk,33.58,33.78
about,33.79,34.07
today,34.07,34.62
is,34.76,34.97
ways,34.969999,35.369999
to,35.369999,35.699999
re,35.709999,35.999999
use,36,36.24
codes,36.24,36.71
codes,36.25,36.71
by,36.71,36.88
developing,36.89,37.48
it,37.48,37.62
as,37.68,37.82
its,37.82,37.9
independent,37.91,38.45
modules,38.45,39.03
so,39.2,39.37
that,39.37,39.47
we,39.47,39.6
can,39.6,39.76
build,39.76,39.99
big,40,40.22

from,40.87,41.07
small,41.07,41.42

[noise],42.27,42.79
now,42.79,42.92
the,42.92,43.07
idea's,43.07,43.42
called,43.42,43.64
modular,43.65,44.13
programming,44.13,44.83
and,44.95,45.08
it's,45.08,45.24
been,45.24,45.37
around,45.37,45.62
for,45.62,45.74
a,45.74,45.79
long,45.79,46.01
time,46.01,46.43
what,46.73,46.93
we,46.929999,47.029999
wanted,47.03,47.23
to,47.23,47.25
do,47.25,47.39
is,47.389999,47.549999

a,50.83,50.9

together,51.23,51.73
and,52.26,52.38
the,52.379999,52.459999
reason,52.469999,52.809999
that,52.809999,52.889999
we,52.9,53.05
wanna,53.049999,53.269999
do,53.27,53.45
that,53.449999,53.649999
is,53.65,53.86
that,53.859999,54.009999
it's,54.01,54.25
easier,54.35,54.76
to,54.76,54.91

in,55.41,55.59
reuse,55.59,55.98

work,61.5,61.71
together,61.71,62.21
and,62.429999,62.579999
what,62.58,62.7
we,62.7,62.81
need,62.809999,63.099999
is,63.11,63.32
tools,63.32,63.81
to,63.809999,63.939999
make,63.94,64.2
the,64.2,64.3

[noise],66.3,66.8
now,66.799999,67.229999
this,67.309999,67.529999

been,67.679999,67.859999
an,67.86,67.97

ah,71.1,71.29
ah,71.289999,71.389999
and,71.389999,71.419999
it's,71.42,71.58
really,71.58,71.88
kind,71.91,72.1
of,72.1,72.21
a,72.209999,72.289999

in,72.99,73.15
software,73.15,73.65
development,73.66,74.19
ah,74.64,74.82
there's,74.82,75.18
a,75.21,75.31

of,75.49,75.59
difficulties,75.59,76.2

so,80.22,80.39
we,80.389999,80.489999
have,80.5,80.69
to,80.69,80.89

now,84.48,84.9
for,85.11,85.24
this,85.24,85.43

we're,88.139999,88.259999
gonna,88.26,88.42
